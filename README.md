exi-test
========

Turn big XML files into small EXI files. This is a collection of utility scripts and tools in Bash, R, and Java to conduct testing of [Efficient XML Interchange](http://www.w3.org/XML/EXI/), a W3C standard for efficient binary encodings of XML. Primary project goals:

* Compare EXI compactness to binary JSON equivalents, [CBOR](http://cbor.io/) and [BSON](http://bsonspec.org/)
* Explore the impact of EXI encoding options on EXI compactness.
* Explore the impact of varying XML Schema quality on EXI compactness.
